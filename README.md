# Production-Grade AWS Glue ETL Pipeline

This repository contains Terraform code to provision a production-grade AWS Glue ETL pipeline architecture that processes large-scale data with high reliability, performance, and maintainability.

## Architecture Overview

The architecture implements a serverless ETL pipeline using AWS Glue with support for both batch and streaming data processing. It includes comprehensive guardrails for error handling, monitoring, security, and operational excellence.

Key components:
- AWS Glue ETL Jobs (Spark/Python)
- AWS Glue Workflows for orchestration
- S3 buckets for data storage (raw, processed, curated)
- AWS Glue Data Catalog for metadata management
- CloudWatch for monitoring and alerting
- AWS Lambda for auxiliary processing
- SNS/SQS for notifications and queue management
- AWS EventBridge for event-driven architecture
- AWS DynamoDB for job bookmarking and state management
